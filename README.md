# Hakyll Blog, Example Templates & Yarn Workspaces

Workspaces are a new way to setup your package architecture thatâ€™s available by default starting from Yarn 1.0. It allows you to setup multiple packages in such a way that you only need to run yarn install once to install all of them in a single pass.

In this example we have three workspaces:

- **app**: A Next.js for demos.
- **mobile**: Area for iOS/React Native development.
- **models**: Models for rapid development in **app**.

## Deploy your own

Deploy the example using [Vercel](https://vercel.com):

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/import/project?template=https://github.com/jamescarl/jamescarl/tree/master)

## How to use

Install it and run:

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

Deploy it to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/import?filter=next.js&utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).

> Choose `packages/web-app` as root directory when deploying.
