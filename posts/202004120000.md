### 3.3.2 Softmax Activation

The softmax activation function is the result of

```javascript
softmax(x1,x2,x3,...,xn) = [
 exp(n1)/ exp(n1) + exp(n2) + ... + exp(xn),
 exp(n2)/ exp(n2) + exp(n3) + ... + exp(xn)
]

```

### 3.3.3 Categorical Cross Entropy

> The loss function for multiclass classification

Accuracy is a good metric for performance however as a loss function it suffers from the same zero gradient issue as binary classification.

_**Categorical crossentropy**_ is a generalization of the binary crossentropy into the cases where there are more than two categories.
