## 1.7 Abstraction³
The _abstraction principle_ is the idea of separating patterns from the instances in which they appear.

### 1.7.1 Naming
An example of abstraction and naming might be something like:
```hs 
pi :: Double
pi = 3.141592653589793
```
This allows changing the value in one place vs the many places it might appear i a program.
In computer music a _pitch_ consists of a _pitch class_ and an _octave_.
In Euterpea _"concert A"_ is represented as 
```hs
(A,4)
```
in music this represents the picth class A in the fourth octave.
Defining this looks like:
```hs
a440, concertA :: (PitchClass, Octave)
a440     = (A,4) -- concert A
concertA = (A,4) -- A440
{- 
    As a note multi line comments in haskell look
    like this.
-}
```
We can give several names to the same value in haskell which may help think about different representations of the data as in [_**Machine Learning**_](/posts/202003211701--deep-learning-with-javascript--1.1-1.3)
<!--  [[202003211701--deep-learning-with-javascript--1.1-1.3]]  -->

A larger expression may require writing things more than once:
```hs
x :: Float
x = f (pi * r ** 2 ) + g (pi * r ** 2 )
```
We can abstract this in Haskell by using another expression
```hs
area :: Float
area :: pi * r ** 2
x :: Float
x = f area + g area
```
We can also limit areas scope using a let expression.
```hs
x :: Float
x = let area = pi * r ** 2
    in f area + g area
```
The name for expressions like the one above for `𝜋` is called a _**binding**_.

### 1.7.2 Functional Abstraction

If the original problem looked like:
```hs
x :: Float
x = f (pi * r1 ** 2 ) + g (pi * r2 ** 2 )
```
we could stll abstract this to
```hs
x :: Float
x = let areaF r = pi * r ** 2
    in f (areaF r1) + g (areaF r2)
``` 
This is called functional abstraction.

Now a bit of music theory.
> A _note_ in Euterpea is defined as _pitch_ combined with a _duration_.

* A _duration_ is measured in beats.
* In Euterpea this has type 
  ```hs
  Dur
  ```
*  One note with duration of 1 beat is called a _whole note_
*  One note with duration of ½ beat is called a _half note_
*  This is the smallest performable peace of music in Euterpe besides a rest
*  Its type is _MusicPitch_
*  There functions typesignatures are as follows.
   ```hs 
   note :: Dur -> Pitch -> MusicPitch
   note d p = ???
   rest :: Dur -> MusicPitch
   rest d = ???
   {-Example-}
   note (1/4) (A,4) -- quarter note concert A
   rest  1 -- rest one beat
   ```
* In Euterpea infix operators combine smalle music values into larger ones...
  ```hs
  (:+:) :: MusicPitch -> MusicPitch -> MusicPitch
  (:=:) :: MusicPitch -> MusicPitch -> MusicPitch
  m1 :+: m2 -- plays music pitch m1 and then m2
  m1 :=: m2 -- plays music pitch m1 and m2 simultaneously
  ```
* Euterpea also has a function 
  ```hs
  trans :: Int -> Pitch -> Pitch
  trans i p -- this is the pitch that is i semitones higher than p 
  ```
  
### 1.7.3 Data Abstraction
Representing situations where the number of values is uncertain as a _data structure_ is useful.
To add a single element to the front of a list in haskell the following is used:
```hs
x : xs
C : [D, Ef] == [C, D, Ef] == C : D : Ef : [] 
{- these are all valid ways of creating lists -}
```
for a harmonized list we can define a function _hList_
```hs
hList :: Dur -> [Pitch] -> MusicPitch -- type signature
hList [] = rest 0 -- MusicPitch with 0 duration 
hList d (p : ps) = let hNote dp = note d p :=: note d (trans (-3) p)
                   in hNote d p + hList d ps 
```
**Exercise 1.4**
```hs
mel :: Integer -> Dur -> [Pitch] -> MusicPitch
mel =  let hList :: Integer -> Dur -> [Pitch] -> MusicPitch
                  hList i d [] = rest 0 -- MusicPitch with 0 duration 
                  hList i d (p: ps) = 
                      let hNote :: Integer -> Dur -> Pitch -> MusicPitch 
                          hNote = i d p = note d p :=: note d (trans i p)
                               in hNote i d p :+: hList i d ps
              in hList i d l
```
### 1.8 Haskell Equality vs. Musical Equality
Euterpea formally defines _musical interpretation_ so that the difference of adding a `MusicPitch` with duration 0 is not different from A `MusicPitch` without.. this leads to the axiom:
```katex 
m :+: rest 0 ≡ m
```


## 1.9 Code Reuse and Modularity
Replacing code with smaller abstractions allows us to reuse code and simplify implementation even though this may require more code it is still clearer than the single use of an expression.
