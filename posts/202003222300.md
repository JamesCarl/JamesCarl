## 2.1 Example 1: Predicting download duration with Tensorflow.js

<InlineNotification>

**Goals**

Cover tensors, modeling, and optimization what they are and how thework and how to use them appropriately.

### 2.1.1 Overview
Below are the steps we'll take in order to accept a file size and output an accurate prediction of download time.

<Tabs>
<Tab label="1. Get training data">

 > This will be an array.

* **Example:**
  ```js
  const training_data = [x₁, x₂ ... xₓ]
  ```

</Tab>
<Tab label="2. Convert Data to Tensors">

> Data representations must be tensors.

</Tab>
<Tab label="3. Create Model">

> Build a simple linear model that is Keras compatible with the Tensorflow.js _layers_.

</Tab>
<Tab label="4. Fit Model to Data">

> Fit the model to the training

</Tab>

<Tab label="5. Use model on new data">

> Predict time form file size.
