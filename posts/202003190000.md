## 1.1 Note vs. Signal 
<Row>
<Column colMd={5} colLg={8}>

A note is the lowest level musical entity, and algorithms, grammar based systems and fratal systems can be used to compose music. While the signal level focuses on the actual sound generated in a computer music application.

<Column colMd={2} colLg={3} offsetMd={1} offsetLg={1}>

**Fun Fact**

Human sample rate is 44,100 samples per second for determing discrete from contiuous signals.

</Column>
</Row>




Euterpea treats signals as contiuous quantities. Signal level analysis allows synthesis, audio processing and special effects. Storage sizes of samples are referred to as bit depth and can range from 16 to 32 bits. Playing a note requires at the note level requires only a handful of byte while the signal level may require tens of thousands of bytes.
## 1.2 Basic Principles of Programming
In computer music  clarity is often important when writing programs because it represents the authors thought process, intent and artistic choices.
