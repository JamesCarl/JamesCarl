## 2.2 Notes, Music, and Polymorphism

- Constructing musical values as recursive data types allows us to deconstruct them print their structure and analyze them in a structure preserving way.
- `Control` is used by the `Modify` constructor to annotate a `Music` value with a:
    - _tempo change_
    - _transposition_
    - _phase attribute_
    - _instrument_
    - _key signature_
    - _custom label_
- `AbsPitch` is a type synonym for `Int`
- `KeySig` constructors attach a _key signature_ to a `Music` vlue 
    - _this is different from transposition_

## 2.3 Convenient Auxiliary Functions

The following are defined in Euterpea for convenience

```haskell

note :: Dur -> a -> Music a
note d p = Prim (Note d p)

rest :: Dur Music a
rest d = Prim (Rest d)

tempo :: Dur -> Music a -> Music a
tempo r m = Modify (Tempo r) m

transpose :: AbsPitch -> Music a -> Music a
transpose i m = Modify (Transpose i) m 
 
instrument :: InstrumentName -> Music a -> Music a
instrument i m = Modify (Instrument i) m
 
phrase :: [PhraseAttribute] -> Music a -> Music a
phrase pa m = Modify (Phrase pa) m
 
keysig :: PitchClass -> Mode -> Music a -> Music a     
keysig pc mo m = Modify(KeySig pc mo) m 
 
```

### 2.3.1 Example

_**A ii-V-I chord progression in a particular major key can be created by:**_
-  arranging a minor chord on the second degree of the major scale
-  followed by a major chord on the fifth degree 
-  ending in a major chord on the first degree


**This is expressed in haskell as ** <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>⬇︎</b>



```haskell

t251 :: Music Pitch
t251 = let dMinor = d 4 wn :=: f 4 wn :=: a 4 wn
           gMajor = g 4 wn :=: b 4 wn :=: d 5 wn
           cMajor = c 4 bn :=: e 4 bn :=: g 4 bn
       in dMinor :+: gMajor :+: cMajor 

```


**We can play this progression with the play function in _GHCi_** <br/>

```haskell
> play t251
```
